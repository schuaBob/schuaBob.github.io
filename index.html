                    <p class="card-text">In strategic video games like card games or chess, although tools exist to
                        calculate the optimal win rate for the next round based on a chosen action, experienced players
                        often opt for actions they subjectively deem the best, challenging the predictions of rational
                        choice models.</p>

                    <p class="card-text">The proposed solution is the development of an "Advanced Real Time Game
                        Statistic AI"
                        system to integrate ToM into video card games. Utilizing game theory and multi-agent
                        reinforcement
                        learning algorithms, the system provides advanced feedback beyond win rates. It challenges
                        players'
                        expectations, offers insights into optimal actions, and encourages self-reflection by justifying
                        non-promoted moves.</p>

                    <p class="card-text">This seciton involves professional and amateur players playing the game twice:
                        once
                        following the
                        highest win rate action and once following system-promoted actions aligned with their beliefs.
                        The win
                        rates of these approaches will be compared to assess the system's effectiveness. The study aims
                        to
                        understand the impact of consistent experience in complex real-time multiplayer video card
                        games, but
                        the expected results lack a clear hypothesis and consideration of potential limitations.</p>
